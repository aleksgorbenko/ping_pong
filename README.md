## Launching

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) need to be installed locally to use the above command.

1. Download the project to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run `npm install` then `bower install`. If you don't have [Bower](https://bower.io/) installed, then run `npm install -g bower' first.
4. Run the following command: `gulp webserver` to start the local server.

Terminal will show you the local address at which the server starts. Copy that address to your browser bar.

Alternatively you can just drop index.html file in your browser.
